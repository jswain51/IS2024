            From 2020-2021, I served an LDS mission in Rome, Italy. It was an amazing experience and I had the time of my life.
            I got to serve all around the southern half of Italy; in Puglia, Naples, Calabria, Sicily, Rome, and Sardegna!
            Here, I will share some of my favorite places I went to, and a fun fact about each one. But first about Italy:
            Italy is an iconic region full of historical literature, art, and architecture. Given the beautiful beaches of Puglia and Sardegna
            with the mountains of the North in Lombardy and Piedmont, Italy also has picturesque landscapes. And of course the food: pizza, pasta,
            gelato, pastries and more in all their delectable varieties. All of this, in addition to the fashion, the cars, and all the cultural
            vibrancy, it is no wonder that Italy is destination unlike any other!

                        <li>The Sella del Diavolo (or the Devil's Saddle) gets its name from legend. The legend says that Lucifer
                            decided to conquer the land after seeing the beauty of Cagliari's Gulf. But, he was promptly stopped by
                            God, who sent angels to fight Lucifer. During this fight in the skies, Lucifer's horse lost its Saddle
                            after being hit, and the saddle fell into the sea and petrified, creating what we have on earth.
